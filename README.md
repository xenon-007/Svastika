# Real-Time Posture Monitoring and Productivity Tracking System

This project is a real-time computer vision application designed to monitor and improve user posture, using OpenCV and MediaPipe for body tracking. The system works with a webcam or CCTV to continuously analyze body posture, offering instant visual feedback and on-screen annotations to guide users toward better posture for enhanced productivity.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Posture Monitoring:** Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to track and monitor user posture in real-time.
- **Instant Visual Feedback & Annotations:** Provides on-screen alerts and visual cues to notify users of improper posture and suggest adjustments.
- **Posture-Based Productivity Insights:** Tracks posture alongside productivity metrics to highlight how posture influences work efficiency and overall performance.
- **Health and Productivity Focus:** Designed to improve well-being by promoting proper posture, aiming to reduce discomfort and prevent health issues, particularly in office environments.
- **Adaptable for Home or Office Use:** While ideal for corporate environments, the system can also be customized for home use, especially in remote work setups, encouraging better posture during long hours of work.

This solution is suited for businesses wanting to boost workplace ergonomics, enhance employee health, and improve productivity, as well as for individuals seeking to track and improve their posture in everyday settings.

**Technologies:**
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and tracking.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for real-time body pose estimation.
